## 04 Drawing a Triangle

**Triangle**

Rasterization pipeline converts ==all== primitives to triangles

Why?

- can approximate any shape 
- always planar(平面的), well-defned normal 
- easy to interpolate data at corners by ==barycentric coordinates==

Key reason: once everything is reduced to triangles, can focus on making an ==extremely well-optimized pipeline== for drawing them

**Coverage**

**Sampling**

- Sampling = measurement of a signal
  - Encode signal as discrete set of samples
  - In principle, represent values at specifc points (though hard to measure in reality!) 

- Reconstruction = generating signal from a discrete set of samples
  - Construct a function that interpolates or approximates function values

**Sampaling for coverage**
$$
\text{coverage}(x,y)=\left\{
             \begin{array}{ll}
             1,&\text{if the triangle contains point(x,y)}\\
             0,&\text{otherwise}
             \end{array}
\right.
$$

Resampling a densely sampled signal (supersampled) integrates coverage values over the entire pixel region. The integrated result is sent to the display (and emitted by the pixel) so that the light emitted by the pixel is similar to what would be emitted in that screen region by an “infnite resolution display”

**Aliasing**

Undersampling high-frequency signals results in aliasing 

**Nyquist-Shannon theorem**

Consider a band-limited signal: has no frequencies above $\omega_0$ 

The signal can be perfectly reconstructed if sampled with period $T=1/(2\omega_0)$

And interpolation is performed using a “sinc flter”, $\text{sinc}(x)=\frac{\sin(\pi x)}{\pi x}$

**Challenges of sampling-based approaches in graphics**

Our signals are not always band-limited in computer graphics.

infnite extent of “ideal” reconstruction flter (sinc) is impractical for efficient implementations. 

**Evaluate  $\text{coverage}(x,y)$**
